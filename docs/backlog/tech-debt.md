## TD-001 — MemberHomeSectionEmptyCard missing optional CTA slot
Source: docs/reviews/member-home-20260405.md
Feature: member-home
Added: 2026-04-05
Effort: S
`MemberHomeSectionEmptyCard` accepts only `title` and `body`. The design spec says "with a CTA where applicable." Add an optional `cta?: { label: string; onClick: () => void }` prop to avoid a breaking change when a future empty state needs an inline action.

## TD-002 — MembershipAccessBanner `already-active` variant uses out-of-system blue tokens
Source: docs/reviews/member-home-20260405.md
Feature: member-home
Added: 2026-04-05
Effort: S
`border-blue-500/30 bg-blue-500/10 text-blue-100` are not defined in the design system. Align with an existing semantic token (orange informational or neutral gray) before blue spreads to other components.

## TD-003 — Plan teasers loading flicker in useMemberHomeMembershipSection
Source: docs/reviews/member-home-20260405.md
Feature: member-home
Added: 2026-04-05
Effort: S
At `useMemberHomeMembershipSection.ts:132`, `planTeasersLoading` is set to `true` before the plan fetch effect fires, causing a brief skeleton flash on slow connections. Initialise to `false` and let the effect set it to `true` on first run, or coalesce the two loading states.

## TD-004 — Duplicate INVALID_TIME_ZONE exception handlers in GlobalExceptionHandler
Source: docs/reviews/member-home-20260405.md
Feature: member-home
Added: 2026-04-05
Effort: S
`GlobalExceptionHandler.kt:585-595` has two separate handler methods for `InvalidTimeZoneException` and `MemberHomeInvalidTimeZoneException`, both mapping to `INVALID_TIME_ZONE`. Unify by having `MemberHomeInvalidTimeZoneException` extend the existing exception, or merge into a single handler.
